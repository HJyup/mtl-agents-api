Currently, there are 2 models:

- **Calendar Agent**: Responsible for updating and adding events to the calendar for the user. If the user starts a sentence with "cl," automatically use this agent.

- **Things Agent**: Responsible for creating or searching a to-do list for the user. If the user starts a sentence with "th," automatically use this agent.

- **General Agent**: Just answers any messages from user if context is not covered by any other models.
